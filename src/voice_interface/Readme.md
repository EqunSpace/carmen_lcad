# 1. Creating an account at Google Cloud Console

To begin to use a Google Cloud API, you must have a Google account.

- Select or create a GCP project names: voice_interface. [Go to the Manage Page Resources](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager?_ga=2.159473469.-1617484999.1535991245)

- Make sure that billing is enabled for your project. [Learn how to enable Billing](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project)

- Enable the APIs. First, access the [search page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library?project=voice-iara&folder&organizationId), select the project in the top bar, and search for "Cloud Text-to-Speech API". Click the banner and select activate in the next page. Repeat the process, but this time search for "Cloud Speech API" to activate the  Speech-to-Text API. 

- Set up authentication:
	- Go to the [Create Service Account Key](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey?_ga=2.62067500.-1617484999.1535991245) page in the GCP Console. (*Menu(â‰¡) ->  API&Services -> Credentials*)
	- From the Service account drop-down list, select *New service account*.
	- Enter a name into the Service account name field: *voice_interface_account* (the Service account name will come with a number series, you'll rename it later).
	- From the Role drop-down list, set *Owner*.
	- Click *Create*.
	- A JSON file that contains your key will start to download with a default name: *project-name-number-series.json*
 	- Rename it to our default name (*voice_interface_credentials.json*) and save it at *~/credentials/*
```sh
cd ~
mkdir credentials
mv ~/Downloads/voice_interface_number_series.json ~/credentials/voice_interface_credentials.json
```
  
# 2. Already have an account? (but changed your computer?)

- Create a new service account, but at the same service account and project: [Create NEW Service Account Key](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey?_ga=2.62067500.-1617484999.1535991245)
- Verify if the right project is set at the top of the page.
- Select the service account: voice_interface_account.
- Select 'JSON' as key type.
	- A JSON file that contains your key will start to download with a default name: *project-name-number-series.json*
	- Rename it to our default name (*voice_interface_credentials.json*) and save it at *~/credentials/*
```sh
cd ~
mkdir credentials
mv ~/Downloads/voice_interface_number_series.json ~/credentials/voice_interface_credentials.json
```

# 3. Setting variables
- Set the environment variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS to the file path of the JSON file that contains your service account key.
```
 nano ~/.bashrc
``` 
 Add at the end of bashrc:
```
#Voice Interface
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=~/voice_interface_credentials.json
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$CARMEN_HOME/src/voice_interface
```
- At the terminal:
```
bash
```
(*still necessary?*)
- Install and initialize [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/#deb)
```sh
export CLOUD_SDK_REPO="cloud-sdk-$(lsb_release -c -s)"
echo "deb http://packages.cloud.google.com/apt $CLOUD_SDK_REPO main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-cloud-sdk.list
curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install google-cloud-sdk
```
Run the SDK to set configurations:
```sh
gcloud init
```

# 4. Install the Client Library

Examples of the Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text APIs:

Using Python3 (3.5.2 or greater)
```
pip3 install --upgrade google-cloud-texttospeech
pip3 install --upgrade google-cloud-speech
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev
pip3 install pyaudio
```

### 6. Tips

  
### 7. Problems to be solved

	- Billing account? The same json can be used for everybody? 
		- A: Using the same Google account you can create multiple service keys and designate roles to which one.
  	
	- When you run "gcloud init", it asks the user to login. Will it work in a different machine? Can we upload the config file (the .boto saved at ~/.boto)? Is this enough? In the end of the process, it says "You can create additional configurations if you work with multiple accounts and/or projects. Run "gcloud topic configurations" to learn more.". Will we have one account for the whole IARA project, or one for each developer?
		- A:
 
	- Try to make the system work with Python3. (SOLVED)
	- Add a timeout to the listen function.
	- Make sure the packages required by python-pyaudio don't break stuff like the nvidia driver (some 'mesa' related packages are installed).
	- Change the speak function to send the audio to the speakers without having to save the file in the disk. (SOLVED)
	- Make the speak function synchronous: the function should only finish after the speakers played the sentence.
