Download the Arduino IDE from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software (it was tested on version 1.8.5)
Extract and install ( ./install )

It's important to download the IDE from the aduino website, because it has the updated version of the SPI Library

If you prefer you can install the Custom Libraries (MCP_CAN and MCP_DAC):
	Open the Arduino IDE
	Go to Sketch >> Include Library >> Add .ZIP Library...
	Select the libraries to install

	The MCP_CAN was provided by https://github.com/coryjfowler/MCP_CAN_lib
	The MCP_DAC was created and has not been tested so much, so it may contain some bugs

Now just compile and upload the code to the arduino

Connecting the hardware to the arduino NANO:

The Vout_X will provide two analog signals and tshould be connected to your actuators.
The ~SHDN will shut down the converters if in LOW level, as we control this by software this pin can stay disconnected
The Vref_X is the reference voltage to the output. The input signal can range from VSS to VDD. These pins can be tied to VDD.(Datasheet page 17).
